This repository contains two scripts for automate the tune of the IRD models 'SENCORE MDR4400' and 'Ericsson8200'. In the case of the Sencore, the script search in a json file that is supposed to contains the IGMP data of several MpegOIP signal's data. The signals are opened on the IRD throught the IP input of the device. On the other hand, the script for the Ericsson tune the IRD using the RF input with a selected carrier (using the frecuency and the BISS code writed in a .txt file)
